# Menu_management_project

This is a C Sharp project, and its goal is to implement a class that assists in the presentation and management of hierarchical menus for Console applications.

The MainMenu class will allow its user to build the menu hierarchy by defining and adding menu items and sub-items to each item and so on.

The implementation itself is done in two ways: once with interfaces and a second time with delegates.

In the implementation itself, a simple menu is displayed that demonstrates how simple it is to use the code (that is in class Main in Menus.Test).
